🌍 AQI_Justice — Fight Pollution with Legal Power
"Clean air is not a privilege. It’s a legal right."

AQI_Justice is a civic-tech platform that transforms real-time air pollution data into actionable legal enforcement.
When air quality crosses legal limits, citizens can instantly file evidence-backed complaints against responsible authorities — no legal knowledge required.


🚨 Why This Matters
In cities like Delhi, AQI frequently exceeds hazardous and illegal levels, leading to:

*Respiratory diseases
*Heart conditions
*Premature deaths

📌 The laws already exist.
📌 The data already exists.
❌ But citizens lack simple tools to act.

"Pollution is treated as a statistic — not a crime."
